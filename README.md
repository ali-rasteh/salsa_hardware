# TRACER_HARDWARE

This project is a hardware implementation for a wireless spectrum sensing and tracking SoC
which contains several Systollic Arrays with a customized architecture.
Each Array is capable of efficiently performing different tasks like FFT, FIR, matrix vector and matrix matrix multiplication, etc.

## Usage
- Install ICARUS Verilog (iverilog) on your Windows/Linux Machine and build your desired testbench according to [this repo](https://github.com/steveicarus/iverilog).
- Run the testbench using the generated output file.
